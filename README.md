Speech To Text Echo server with faster-whisper

This repository is a local Speech-to-Text (STT) server created for personal project use.  
It functions as an echo server using HTTP, streaming audio input and returning the recognized text as output.

The server uses the Faster Whisper model, and was inspired by the following repositories:  
- [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)  
- [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)
